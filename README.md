This project is an end-to-end image captioning generator that uses deep learning to create descriptive captions for images. 
It combines computer vision and natural language processing using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer models. 
The model first extracts features from images with a CNN, then generates captions with an encoder-decoder Transformer architecture.
